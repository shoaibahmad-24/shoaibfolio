              The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is a historic fortress located
              in the heart of Old Delhi, India. Constructed in the 17th century by
              the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, the Red Fort is an architectural
              marvel that represents the grandeur and power of the Mughal Empire.
              Made from red sandstone, the fort's imposing walls stretch over two
              kilometers and enclose a sprawling complex of palaces, gardens, and
              pavilions. The main entrance, known as the Lahori Gate, leads to the
              magnificent Chatta Chowk, a covered bazaar where exquisite
              handicrafts and traditional goods are still sold today. Inside the
              fort, visitors can explore the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public
              Audience), where the emperor would meet his subjects, and the
              Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), adorned with intricate
              marble inlays. The fort also houses the stunning Rang Mahal (Palace
              of Colors) and the Zenana (Royal Harem), showcasing the luxurious
              lifestyle of the Mughal rulers. Every year, on the occasion of
              India's Independence Day, the prime minister hoists the national
              flag at the Red Fort, symbolizing the nation's freedom and
              sovereignty. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Red Fort is not only
              a testament to India's rich history and architectural prowess but
              also a significant cultural and national symbol. <br />

              The Konark Sun Temple, located in Konark, Odisha, India, is a
              masterpiece of ancient Indian architecture and a UNESCO World
              Heritage Site. Built in the 13th century by King Narasimhadeva I of
              the Eastern Ganga dynasty, the temple is dedicated to the Hindu sun
              god, Surya. The temple's design represents a colossal chariot with
              intricately carved stone wheels, horses, and other mythical
              creatures. The main sanctum, known as the Garbhagriha, once housed a
              massive stone idol of Surya that has now been lost. The temple's
              walls are adorned with exquisite stone carvings depicting scenes
              from Hindu mythology, celestial nymphs, and intricate ornamentation.
              The precise positioning of the temple ensures that the first rays of
              the rising sun pass through its main entrance. The Konark Sun Temple
              is not only a testament to the architectural brilliance of the era
              but also a symbol of reverence towards the sun god and a significant
              cultural and religious landmark in India.
